## WGMESH 2.0

The 1.0 branch defined the problem.

The 2.0 branch should be involved with making the core code cleaner and more refined.

The github version publishing should be automated.  PyPi publishing docs are missing as well.


### Easy

* crypto operations should have their own module
* locus should be reported when we're doing stuff.
* trace should never reveal the private keys
* the cli needs to be simplified now that we know what we're using.
* dns cleanup dead/removed hosts needs to be a thing.
* wgsite should have a command to list/add/delete hosts
* wgsite --import should be an 'add' operation
* JSON should be used for all document exchange.  YAML is only for storing files.
* A means of rekeying the site, and the hosts should be addressed.
* Document the Communication workflow.
    * site init should be a series of questions.
        * wgsite init
        * wgsite publish
        * wgsite host <add/delete>
    * the init process should print instructions for the new user.
    * the host config should happen in 2 steps, using the same command.
    * the host setup process should print instructions for the new user.
        * wgsetup host <config>
        * wgsetup publish -> message
        * wgsetup deploy -> local config

### Difficult

* dns should happen via extension points which can be used like interfaces.
* Eliminate shorewall and move to firewalld
* unit tests should be written for the crypto/communication process
    * generate a site
    * create two hosts
    * import keys
    * publish site config

The cli is inconsistent and all over the place.


## WGMESH 3.0

Implement the site-coordination API.  The logic needs to be worked out for this process, but
it is clear.

* Communication should happen via the wgmesh api
* Redundant hosts should be possible and normal
* some degree of firewall rules should be part of the host config
* interface-based routing protocol configuration

## Ideas without a home

* RAFT framework for connected nodes to pass configuration changes?
* Time-based check-in for node updates and upgrades
